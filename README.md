# Predicting Car Prices

In this project, I used a car data set to make prediction on car's price. The data set has data from diffirent car brands. I used pandas and numpy libraries to open and prepare data set to predict. I cleaned missing values. Especially, I cleaned missing values from the "price" column to use it on my prediction.

I used knn classification models with sklearn library. I found random mean squared errors to test my model's performance. I developed my models step by step. I developed models to make prediction on one column. After that I used improved knn model to make prediction on multiple columns.  I used matplotlib library to visualize the "RMSE" values for every k value.  

## Conclusion

As a result, the "RMSE" value increases as k value increases when I use multiple columns.
